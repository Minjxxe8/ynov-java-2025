Distant flickerings, greener scenery
This weather's bringing it all back again
Great adventures, faces and condensation
I'm going outside and take it all in

You say is too late to start, got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say is too late to start, with your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

Wear a different pair, do something out of step
Throw a stranger an unexpected smile
With big intention, still posted at your station
Always on about the day it should have flied

You say is too late to start, got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say is too late to start, with your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this
Afraid to start, got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say is too late to start, with your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

You've been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye
You've been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

You know you're better than this

Canâ€™t make you start, got your heart in a headlock
No, I don't believe any of it
You say is too late to start, with your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this
Afraid to start, got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say is too late to start, with your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this
